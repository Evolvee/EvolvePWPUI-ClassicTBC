# PartyAbilityBars for Classic TBC by Schaka
### Thanks to Kollektiv for doing the initial work

Added:
- race functionality
- PvPTrinket functionality  
- spells from COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED

Notes:
- Code wasn't cleaned up, just made functional until someone bothers to port AbilityTeamTracker
- Might port it myself if I can be bothered, but code is more convoluted and I'm too lazy
