- Update frFR.lua; pull request #3 from Hantunaar/patch-2  
- Update frFR.lua  
    Added back missing entries (was there a data loss? I haven't updated at all during Classic), fixed typos, re-worded for better fitting when needed. Copied the german file's structure as it felt more convenient than alphabetical ordering.
